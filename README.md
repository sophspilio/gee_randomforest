# Random Forest Classification using Google Earth Engine
Sample code for running a random forest classification in Google Earth Engine. 

This code was adapted from a tutorial in Clark University's GEOG 282: Advanced Remote Sensing. Any satellite imagery can replace the `pop10` variable and training sites replace the `training_pop10`.
